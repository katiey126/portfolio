Responsive page: about page

I had the most trouble with the projects page since the frame I wanted to use wasn't
perfectly rectangular and the lines were a bit too thick, so it was hard to make the image fit smoothly inside it. 
I ended up changing the design to have just the images without the frames.
I also changed the format of the about page to be just text since I realized I didn't want to use a photo.

Some changes I would like to make in the future:
- Adding a customized hand drawn cursor
- Adding more projects to the project page and turning them into a carousel
- Drawing a more suitable frame to use for the projects
- Using a crumpling/unfolding transitions when moving between pages
- More movement and interactive elements (shifting positions of non nav bar clouds, stick figure moving when clicked, 
smoke coming out of house chimney, maybe adding a photo to the about page that can be drawn on, etc.)
