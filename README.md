Name: Katie Yang
Responsive page: about page

I had the most trouble with the projects page since I had to figure out how to position
images inside the frames and with things having different aspect ratios, but it eventually
worked out as I had intended. I also changed the format of the about page just because I 
realized I didn't want to use a photo.

Some changes I would like to make in the future:
- Adding a customized hand drawn cursor
- Adding more projects to the project page and turning them into a carousel
- Using a crumple/unfolding transitions when moving between pages
- More movement and interactive elements (shifting positions of non nav bar clouds, stick figure moving when clicked, 
smoke coming out of house chimney, maybe adding a photo to the about page that can be drawn on, etc.)
