My personal website

future changes:
- Adding a customized hand drawn cursor
- Adding more projects to the project page and turning them into a carousel
- Drawing a more suitable frame to use for the projects
- Using a crumpling/unfolding transitions when moving between pages
- More movement and interactive elements (shifting positions of non nav bar clouds, stick figure moving when clicked, 
smoke coming out of house chimney, maybe adding a photo to the about page that can be drawn on, etc.)
